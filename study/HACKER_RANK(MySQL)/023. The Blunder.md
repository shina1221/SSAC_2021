Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's 0 key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), and the actual average salary.

Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.: actual-miscalculated average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.

Input Format

The EMPLOYEES table is described as follows:

Note: Salary is per month.

Sample Output

2061

Explanation

The table below shows the salaries without zeros as they were entered by Samantha:

Samantha computes an average salary of 98.00. The actual average salary is 2159.00.

The resulting error between the two calculations is 2159.00-98.00=2061.00 Since it is equal to the integer 2061, it does not get rounded up
