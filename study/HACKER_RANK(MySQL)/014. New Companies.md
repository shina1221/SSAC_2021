Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees. Order your output by ascending company_code.

Note:

The tables may contain duplicate records.
The company_code is string, so the sorting should not be numeric. For example, if the company_codes are C_1, C_2, and C_10, then the ascending company_codes will be C_1, C_10, and C_2.

#Inner join 사용  
-FROM ~ INNER JOIN ()
-FROM ~ INNER JOIN (SELECT ~ FROM ~ GROUP BY ~) '약칭' ON '조건'
-company_code 기준으로 값을 서치하므로 Group by company_code
-중복된 데이터가 있기 때문에 DISTINCT  

SELECT company.company_code, company.founder, lead.lead_count, senior.senior_count,  
       manager.manager_count, employee.employee_count  
FROM company  
 INNER JOIN (SELECT company_code, COUNT(DISTINCT(lead_manager_code)) AS lead_count  
             FROM lead_manager  
             GROUP BY company_code) lead ON company.company_code = lead.company_code  
 INNER JOIN (SELECT company_code, COUNT(DISTINCT(senior_manager_code)) AS senior_count

ORDER BY company.company_code  

#WHERE 구문만 사용하는 방법
-company_code에 속하는 매니저들과 직원들의 명수를 구하려는 과정에서 Founder도 출력해줘야 하기 때문에 company. founder 2개의 column을 기준으로 그룹핑 해야함.  

SELECT c.company_code, c.founder,  
       COUNT(DISTINCT(l.lead_manager_code)), COUNT(DISTINCT(s.senior_manager_code)),  
       COUNT(DISTINCT(m.manager_code)), COUNT(DISTINCT(e.employee_code))  
FROM company c, lead_manager l, senior_manager s, manager m, employee e  
WHERE c.company_code = l.company_code AND  
      l.lead_manager_code = s.lead_manager_code AND  
      s.senior_manager_code = m.senior_manager_code AND  
      m.manager_code = e.manager_code  
GROUP BY c.company_code, c.founder   
ORDER BY c.company_code
