We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly  salary x months worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as 2 space-separated integers.

69952 1

Explanation

The table and earnings data is depicted in the following diagram:

The maximum earnings value is 69952. The only employee with earnings = 69952 is Kimberly, so we print the maximum earnings value (69952) and a count of the number of employees who have earned $69952 (which is 1) as two space-separated values.
